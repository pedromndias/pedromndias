## 🌟 Featured Projects

- [Appilime](https://github.com/pedromndias/appilime-client) - Productivity app with focus environment and task features like To-Dos List, Expenses tracker, Timer, Weather based on location, BTC and ETH crypto prices and a game. Depending on your mood, you can change the theme and all the app will show a different style and the music playlist will also vary accordingly.
- [Imperial Archives](https://github.com/pedromndias/imperial-archives) - Social network where users can comment on different Star Wars characters, add as favorite, and see info on all movies and series. Users can filter characters by their species or homeworld. Moderators can add new characters and edit them. The administrator can delete users if not the moderator.
- [Let's Ride to France Game](https://github.com/pedromndias/lets-ride-to-france-game) - A fun game where the player needs to avoid traffic on the highway from Barcelona until Toulouse (France). When reaching different cities (Girona and Toulouse), there will be more traffic, making it more difficult for the motorcycle not to hit cars or roadblocks. If we crash, there will be an ambulance taking care of us, so we have a second chance either to try again or to train in an off-road environment.
